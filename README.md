# KnockbackModifier

Change the amount of knockback players take in different worlds
This plugin is fairly simple to use,

-To modify the amount of knockback in a world do /kbset (multiply amount) (world name)
the world name you put into the plugin must be the same as what it is in the \worlds folder, if the name has spaces enclose the name in ""

-To change the knockback level in all worlds do /kbset (multiply amount) global
-To make no change to the knockback simply set the multiply amount to 1 in the command.
using the command without specifying what world to set the knockback in will change the knockback level of the world you are currently in.

This plugin was desgined to allow server owners to customise how much knockback players receive in different worlds. I.e if you had a practice pvp server and you want different worlds to have different levels of knockback
I hope this plugin helps :)
